# Systolic Simulator
## Presentation
Simulation of the flow of systolic algorithms; where computational unit called "cell" are working on parallel, computing the result given by the last cell before feeding the result into the next one.

## Requirement
This project is done in "modern" C++ with CMake and hence required:
* A C++ compiler supporting **C++17**
* CMake version 3.1 or greater

## Usage
(Instructions to come.)

The Systolic/* files can be used as a standalone library while main.cpp provide an example command line interface.
Look it up for an example for the time being.

## Compilation
### On UNIX
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
will create an executable named `systolic` at the root of the `build` folder.

### On Windows
(Instructions to come.)
